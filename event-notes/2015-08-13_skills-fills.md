people and discussing people's pasts & future endeavors. We got some good ideas
for new workshops/events and have a few upcoming meetings planned.

###Group Organization
- Leila has been emailing with the new WWC team leader in charge of
on boarding new directors. He is going to get back to her on the status of our
application.

- In the meantime he invited us to an on-boarding call scheduled for Wednesday,

We can either all call in or meet up somewhere. If we meet up, Tara will ask
about borrowing the conference call speaker from Modulus.
