#WWC & GDI Meeting
####August 26, 2015 1215 Wine Bar
**ATTENDEES:** Cindy (@ceeblet), Tara (@tzmanics), Becky Sroufe (@beckysroufe) 
& Becky Blank (@beckyblank)

The two chapter leaders of GDI Cincinnati were nice enough to meet with us to
discuss our plans for Cincy WWC and how we could work together to grow 
Cincinnati's women in tech community. We all agreed that the more effort we all
put into the community the better it is for all of us. Here are a few topics 
we touched on:

Since both groups will be offering technical workshops we tried to cover how
they would differ, especially since WWC technical workshops will always remain
free.

###WORKSHOPS/CLASSES
- GDI's workshops are more structured classes that, for now, cover topics 
more on the entry-level side. At the moment GDI classes focus on HTML, CSS, 
Javascript/JQuery, Git/Github, Wordpress & Python.
- WWC plans to provide workshops with a bit of a looser, but guided feel. We 
hope to cover a broader array of topics and go beyond the intro level. As 
discussed in our meeting with WWC, we would like to reach to ladies who are 
comfortable coding in at least one language.
- If GDI or WWC ever feels like we may be encroaching on one another's 
workshop topics we should reach out and see 
  - a. if it's a probelm and
  - b. figure out a good way to resolve the overlap.
- GDI can be a suggested resource we provide to people that want to learn to
code and are at the intro level. Just as WWC can be a resource for GDI grads
who want to go on to higher level workshops.
- Instructors for WWC will be chosen from people who express interest, at the 
moment we do not have a vetting process in place. GDI interviews their 
instructors.
- We noted that we definitely will never actively poach instructors or TA's 
from each other but, of course, it's up to the people. We will also be very 
 happy if they have time for both groups :) and will try to help each other 
with teaching resources when possible.
- Both groups will have technical speakers and panels.

####SOCIAL EVENTS
- WWC is considering doing 50/50 technical workshops and social/
community-building events. Dependent on what the community wants, this may 
change in the future.
- GDI has a weekly Code & Coffee event, happy hour event, hackathons and 
fundraisers.
- Eventually we would be very interested in having a group event where our two 
groups can merge and mingle.

####SPONSORS
- Gaining sponsors and funds has been quite hard work for GDI and is 
something they are always working on attaining. Although WWC will be looking 
for sponsors to provide us with space, WIFI & food, we should not need many 
resources.
- This is another area that we hope we will be able to help each other and try 
to make sure we don't put sponsors in a position that they feel they have to 
choose one group over another.

We held this meeting to open up communication between WWC & GDI in hopes that 
each group feels comfortable contacting each other with questions or requests. 
B.Blank and B.Sroufe will also be joining the Cincy WWC Slack room to keep
up-to-date and chat with us.

We are definitely excited to form this relationship with a group that has been 
spreading the tech knowledge to ladies in our community so successfully! All 
four of us were happy to know both groups are taking strides to grow the 
support for women in our community.
